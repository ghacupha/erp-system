 * the Http GET request parameters.
 * For example the following could be a valid request:
 * {@code /account-ownership-types?id.greaterThan=5&attr1.contains=something&attr2.specified=false}
 * As Spring is unable to properly convert the types, unless specific {@link Filter} class are used, we need to use
