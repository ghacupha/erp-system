/**
 * After many trials we saw that hibernate will keep injecting its own SORT BY
 * clauses into the native queries ruining everything because the id generated
 * is usually generated with a guess as to the table from which we are drawing
 * data and that will lead to issues with the FROM clause, because some of the native
 * queries are complex enough for the FROM clause to not be an obvious guess. The windows
 * and CTE revolution in postgresql have seen to that. Am sure this has been
 * fixed in a later driver or hibernate version, but I being a humble single-contributor
 * coder do not have time and resources to do a full scale upgrade of hibernate and the entire spring
 * framework. The whole Jakarta thing just make the whole process a resource-intensive gig.
 * So for now, patch jobs like this will have to do.
