## Depreciation Rate and Calculation in the Erp System

### Introduction

Depreciation is a crucial concept in accounting and financial management, representing the reduction in value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or other factors. Depreciation rate is a key component in calculating the depreciation expense associated with an asset. In the Erp System, we use a standardized method to define and apply depreciation rates to accurately calculate the depreciation for each asset.

### Depreciation Rate Basis Points

To enhance accuracy, the Erp System has adopted a depreciation rate measurement in basis points (bps). A basis point is equal to 1/100th of a percentage point, allowing for a highly precise representation of the rate. With the use of basis points, the system can accurately calculate depreciation to four decimal places, which increases the alignment between the calculated values and those derived from external sources such as spreadsheets.

### Setting Depreciation Rate

When defining an asset category, users can specify the depreciation rate in basis points. This rate indicates the portion of the asset's value that is depreciated annually. Since the depreciation rate is measured for a whole year, it provides a reliable basis for calculating monthly depreciation.

### Calculation Process

1. **Depreciation Rate Conversion:** The system converts the specified depreciation rate from basis points to a decimal value by dividing it by 10,000. This conversion yields a decimal rate that can be directly used in calculations.

2. **Monthly Depreciation Calculation:** To calculate the monthly depreciation amount, the system divides the annual depreciation rate (converted to a decimal) by 12. This monthly depreciation rate is then used in the depreciation algorithm.

### Granular Unit: Monthly Periods

In the Erp System, a monthly period serves as the primary granular unit for depreciation calculations. This decision was made to simplify the development process and ensure the timely delivery of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). By using monthly periods, elapsed periods can be easily determined using available Java API methods, simplifying the calculation process.


## Handling Different Useful Lives within the Same Asset Category

### Introduction

In certain scenarios, assets within the same asset category may have different useful lives. For instance, in the Erp System, assets categorized under "Office Renovation" may vary in terms of their actual useful life. While a standardized depreciation rate serves most assets within this category well, there are cases where specific assets need to be treated differently due to their distinct useful lives.

### Customized Depreciation Rates

When assets within the same category have varying useful lives, it's essential to ensure accurate depreciation calculations that align with their actual expected lifespan. In such cases, a standardized depreciation rate might not adequately represent the depreciation process. To address this, the Erp System allows for the creation of asset categories with custom depreciation rates tailored to the specific useful life of the asset.

### Scenario Example

Consider a scenario where an office building renovation is capitalized as an asset, falling under the "Office Renovation" category. The building has a lease term of 15 years, and the renovation's useful life aligns with this lease period. If a standardized depreciation rate of 1250 basis points (8-year useful life) were used, it would inaccurately assume an 8-year useful life for all assets within the category.

### Creating Custom Categories

To accurately reflect varying useful lives, the Erp System enables the creation of customized asset categories. In the scenario described above, a new asset category named "Office Renovation - 15 Years" could be established. This category would have a custom depreciation rate calculated based on the desired useful life.

### Calculation Process for Custom Categories

1. **Useful Life Conversion:** When creating a custom asset category, the user defines the actual useful life of the asset, which in this case is 15 years.

2. **Depreciation Rate Calculation:** To determine the appropriate custom depreciation rate, the system performs the following calculation:

   ```
   Custom Depreciation Rate = 10000 / Useful Life
   ```

   For the "Office Renovation - 15 Years" category, the custom depreciation rate would be 666.67 basis points (0.6667%).

### Benefits of Custom Categories

The use of custom asset categories with tailored depreciation rates allows the Erp System to accurately reflect the varying useful lives of assets within a single category. This approach enhances the precision of depreciation calculations and financial reporting, providing a more realistic representation of asset value changes over time.

### Conclusion

The Erp System's flexibility in allowing custom asset categories with specific depreciation rates based on useful life ensures accurate and granular depreciation calculations. By accommodating cases where standardized depreciation rates would lead to inaccuracies, the system maintains its reliability and usability, enabling users to effectively manage assets with varying lifespans.
The adoption of depreciation rates in basis points and the use of monthly periods as the primary granular unit allows the Erp System to accurately calculate asset depreciation. This accuracy is crucial for financial reporting and decision-making processes. By providing precise calculations that closely match external sources, the system enhances its reliability and usability, ensuring that users can confidently manage their assets' financial aspects.
