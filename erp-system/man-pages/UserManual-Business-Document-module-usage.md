**Business Document Module Documentation**

Welcome to the documentation for the Business Document Module in our ERP system. This module serves as a repository for storing scanned business documents, facilitating easy access for all entities within the system. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to utilize this module effectively:

### Overview:

The Business Document Module integrates seamlessly into our ERP system, allowing users to store, retrieve, and manage scanned business documents efficiently. It employs a combination of file system and database workflows to ensure robust data management and security.

### Workflow:

1. **Storage:** When a document is uploaded, it is saved in the file system, while its metadata is stored in the database. This dual-storage approach ensures data integrity and accessibility.

2. **Retrieval:** Documents can be retrieved on demand through the front-end client. The system automatically calculates a SHA-512 checksum for each file, enabling tamper detection. If tampering is detected, the file's metadata is updated accordingly.

### Uploading a Document:

To upload a document, follow these steps:

1. Access the "Business Document" menu.
2. Click on the "Upload Business Document" button.
3. Fill in the document's description and title.
4. Click on the "Choose File" button to select the file from your local file system.
5. Add any additional mappings or placeholders as required.
6. Click the "Save" button to upload the document.

### Accessing a Document:

To access a document, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Business Document" menu.
2. If the desired document is not immediately visible, use the search field or navigate through other pages.
3. Once you locate the document, click on the "View" button to access its details.
4. In the details view, click on the open link associated with the "Document File" field to download the document to your browser.
5. If the document is password-protected, enter the password to view it in the browser.

### Security:

Always ensure that documents are not tampered with. If you suspect any tampering, report it immediately to the system administrator for further action.
