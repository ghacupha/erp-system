## 1. Introduction

The Period Segmentation framework within the Depreciation Module plays a crucial role in accurately calculating and reporting depreciation over time. This documentation outlines the structure and purpose of the fiscal year, fiscal quarter, and fiscal month entities, detailing their integration into the depreciation workflow.

## 2. Fiscal Year Entity

### Definition
The FiscalYear entity represents a financial year's time period. It stores key information such as start and end dates.

### Purpose
The FiscalYear entity provides a high-level segmentation of time, enabling organized tracking of assets' depreciation over complete financial cycles.

### Fields Captured
- ID: Unique identifier for each fiscal year.
- Start Date: The start date of the fiscal year.
- End Date: The end date of the fiscal year.

## 3. Fiscal Quarter Entity

### Definition
The FiscalQuarter entity breaks down a fiscal year into quarters, allowing finer-grained analysis of depreciation over three-month periods.

### Purpose
Fiscal quarters offer a balance between granularity and manageability, enabling better performance assessment and reporting.

### Fields Captured
- ID: Unique identifier for each fiscal quarter.
- Quarter Number: The quarter's numerical identifier.
- Start Date: The start date of the fiscal quarter.
- End Date: The end date of the fiscal quarter.

## 4. Fiscal Month Entity

### Definition
The FiscalMonth entity further divides fiscal quarters into individual months, offering the most granular period segmentation.

### Purpose
Fiscal months provide a comprehensive view of depreciation trends over specific calendar months.

### Fields Captured
- ID: Unique identifier for each fiscal month.
- Month Number: The month's numerical identifier.
- Start Date: The start date of the fiscal month.
- End Date: The end date of the fiscal month.

## 5. Segmenting Periods in Depreciation Calculation

The period entities are seamlessly integrated into the depreciation calculation process. When users specify a period label, the corresponding period entity's information is utilized to accurately calculate depreciation for the selected period.

## 6. Creating and Managing Period Labels

Period labels are associated with the defined period entities to specify the period for depreciation calculations and reporting. Users create, update, and manage period labels to suit reporting and analysis needs.

## 7. Benefits and Flexibility

- Accurate Reporting: The segmented period structure ensures precise depreciation reporting.
- Customizable Analysis: Users can select specific periods for in-depth analysis and comparison.
- Error Management: Period labels enable voiding and replacement of periods in case of errors.

## 8. Integration with Depreciation Workflow

Users incorporate period labels within the depreciation workflow, specifying the desired period for depreciation calculations. The period label's information guides the system in generating accurate depreciation reports.

## 9. Use Cases and Examples

- Selecting Quarterly Reports: Users can choose a fiscal quarter label to generate detailed quarterly depreciation reports.
- Year-to-Date Analysis: A fiscal year label facilitates year-to-date depreciation analysis.

## 10. Best Practices and Recommendations

- Consistent Labeling: Maintain uniform period label naming conventions for clarity and consistency.
- Label Maintenance: Regularly update and manage period labels to reflect accurate reporting periods.

## 11. Conclusion

The Period Segmentation framework provides a structured and flexible approach to track and analyze depreciation over customizable periods. This documentation empowers users to effectively leverage the segmented period structure for accurate depreciation calculations and insightful reporting.
