## Data Migration for Depreciation Calculation: Addressing Inconsistencies and Inaccuracies

### Introduction

In the process of transitioning from manual Excel records to an automated system for asset management and depreciation calculations, several challenges related to data inconsistencies and inaccuracies have been identified. This documentation outlines the issues faced, the proposed solution, and the considerations involved in implementing the solution.

### Issues Identified

1. **Inaccurate Asset Costs:** Historical data includes inconsistencies in recorded asset costs, leading to unreliable depreciation calculations.

2. **Depreciation Period Discrepancies:** Inaccuracies exist in the implementation of depreciation periods, resulting in incorrect depreciation schedules and amounts.

### Proposed Solution

To address the identified issues and ensure accurate and consistent depreciation calculations, we propose the following solution:

**Using Data Loading Date as Baseline:**

1. **Net Book Value as Asset Cost:** Instead of relying on potentially inaccurate historical asset costs, we will use the current net book value as the asset cost for depreciation calculations.

2. **Data Loading Date as Capitalization Date:** To ensure consistent application of the depreciation policy, we will use the data loading date as the capitalization date for calculations.

### Merits of the Proposed Approach

1. **Data Consistency:** Using the data loading date as the baseline establishes a consistent starting point for depreciation calculations, addressing inconsistencies in recorded asset costs and depreciation periods.

2. **Accurate Depreciation:** Calculating depreciation based on the current net book value provides more accurate and reliable results compared to potentially inaccurate historical data.

3. **Non-Intrusive Migration:** The proposed approach avoids the need to modify past transactions or rewrite historical data, minimizing complexity and effort.

4. **Policy Consistency:** Using the data loading date as the capitalization date ensures consistent implementation of the depreciation policy, eliminating discrepancies.

### Considerations and Implementation Steps

1. **Validation:** Thoroughly validate the accuracy of the data loading process to ensure correct net book values and data loading dates.

2. **Audit Trail:** Maintain an audit trail to log changes to asset costs, net book values, and data loading dates for transparency and accountability.

3. **Reporting:** Adjust reporting mechanisms to reflect the new approach for depreciation calculations.

4. **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing to verify the accuracy and consistency of the new approach across various scenarios.

5. **Data Migration:** Plan the migration of historical data to reflect the new asset cost and data loading date logic accurately.

### Conclusion

By using the proposed approach of using the data loading date as the baseline for depreciation calculations, we aim to resolve the issues of data inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This approach ensures accurate, reliable, and consistent depreciation calculations while maintaining transparency and accountability in our processes.

### Data Migration and Adoption Strategy for Depreciation Calculation

`This approach was favored as more consistent with our project plans and was adopted on 29.08.2023 and asset-registration tables amended accordingly`

#### Background

When migrating data from manual Excel records to an automated system for depreciation calculation, various challenges related to data accuracy and policy implementation may arise. Inaccuracies in recorded asset costs and depreciation periods, as well as inconsistencies in policy application, can impact the reliability of the data within the new system.

#### Proposed Solution: Dual Data Fields

To address these challenges and ensure a smooth transition to the new system, a dual data field approach is proposed. This approach aims to provide users with the ability to adopt the automated system while retaining the veracity of historical records and applying accurate depreciation calculations.

#### Key Elements of the Solution

1. **New Fields Addition:**
    - **Historical Cost:** Introduce a new field called "Historical Cost" in the asset registration data. This field will capture the actual acquisition cost of the asset at the time of acquisition.
    - **Registration Date:** Add a "Registration Date" field to record the date on which the asset was acquired or registered.

2. **Separation of Business Record and Depreciation Data:**
    - **Business Records:** The "Historical Cost" and "Registration Date" fields serve as the actual business physical records of the asset's acquisition. These fields remain unchanged and retain the original data.
    - **Depreciation Data:** The "Asset Cost" and "Capitalization Date" fields are used solely for the purpose of depreciation calculations. They can be adjusted to address inaccuracies and inconsistencies, providing a clean and reliable data set for depreciation calculations.

3. **Migration and Adoption:**
    - **For Existing Data:** Users can apply the "Historical Cost" as the "Asset Cost" and the "Registration Date" as the "Capitalization Date" at the time of system adoption. This ensures accurate historical net book values for depreciation calculations.
    - **Going Forward:** Users follow the established policies for asset cost and capitalization dates in the automated system, applying accurate depreciation calculations.

4. **Policy Implementation:**
    - **Accurate Depreciation Calculations:** The system calculates depreciation based on the "Asset Cost" and "Capitalization Date" fields, ensuring accurate and consistent results.
    - **Transparency and Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of the transition strategy, including the adoption process, policy changes, and any adjustments made.

#### Benefits and Considerations

##### Benefits:

1. **Accurate Historical Data:** The dual data fields approach retains the accuracy of historical acquisition records while providing accurate depreciation calculations.
2. **Smooth Adoption:** Users transitioning from manual Excel records can easily adopt the automated system while ensuring accurate depreciation results.
3. **Data Integrity:** Accurate depreciation calculations are maintained for both historical and new data, enhancing data integrity.
4. **Policy Alignment:** The system enforces accurate policy implementation while allowing for the adoption of historical data.

##### Considerations:

1. **User Training:** Proper user training and communication are essential to ensure understanding and correct adoption of the new approach.
2. **Data Verification:** Thoroughly validate and cross-reference data during migration to prevent data errors.
3. **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing to verify the accuracy of the new system's calculations and policies.

#### Conclusion

The proposed dual data fields approach provides a practical solution for users migrating from manual Excel records to an automated system for depreciation calculation. By retaining accurate historical acquisition records and implementing accurate depreciation calculations, this approach ensures a seamless transition while maintaining data integrity and policy compliance. Careful documentation and communication are key to successfully implementing this strategy and ensuring accurate and reliable depreciation calculations.
