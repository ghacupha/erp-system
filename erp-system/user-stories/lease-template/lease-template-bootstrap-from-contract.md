# Lease template bootstrapping from IFRS16 lease contracts

## Story 1: Renew a lease using a prefilled template from the contract list
**Persona:** Lease accountant preparing a renewal for an expiring contract.

**Steps:**
1. Open the IFRS16 lease contract list.
2. Locate the expiring contract (for example, Lease 1001).
3. Click **Create Template**.
4. Review the prefilled lease template update form populated with the contract details and related transaction-account rules.
5. Enter a new template title (for example, "Lease 1023") and adjust any fields that need customization.
6. Save the template.

**Expected outcome:**
- A new lease template is created using the contract’s data and account mappings, ready to be referenced by the next lease contract.

## Story 2: Create a template from a lease contract detail view
**Persona:** Lease manager reviewing contract details before renewal.

**Steps:**
1. Open the IFRS16 lease contract detail page.
2. Click **Create Template**.
3. Confirm the template form is prefilled with the contract’s service outlet, dealer, and transaction-account rule mappings.
4. Provide a template title and make any required edits.
5. Save the template.

**Expected outcome:**
- The template is saved with the prefilled data, allowing downstream lease contracts and schedules to reuse the same structure.
