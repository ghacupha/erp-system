# Story: View repayment period dates on lease liability schedule

## Persona
Lease accounting analyst reviewing monthly liability schedules.

## Goal
Ensure each schedule item clearly shows the configured start and end dates for its repayment period.

## Steps
1. Open the Lease Liability module and navigate to the liability schedule for a lease.
2. Inspect the Start and End columns in the schedule table.
3. Confirm that each row displays the repayment period's start and end dates matching the configuration in Lease Repayment Periods.

## Expected Result
The Start and End columns contain the accurate period dates instead of remaining blank or showing placeholder values. The period code remains visible alongside the dates for cross-reference.
