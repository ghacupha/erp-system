# Story: review liability enumerations with identifiers and exports

## Persona
Finance analyst responsible for reconciling lease liability calculations.

## Narrative
- The analyst opens the Liability Enumerations page and immediately sees the most recent jobs first, each tagged with the lease booking ID and the local date-time the request was initiated.
- They scroll or refresh to fetch additional pages when more than one screen of enumerations is available.
- Selecting an entry opens the present value enumeration view, which is titled with the related contract identifier so the analyst knows which lease they are inspecting.
- From the present value list the analyst can export CSV or XLSX copies of the schedule for offline checks while keeping the on-screen order.
