# Lease amortization schedule activation guide

- Navigate to **Leases → Lease Amortization Schedules**.
- Review the **Status** badge for each schedule. Use **Activate** or **Deactivate** to toggle the schedule and all linked liability schedule items; buttons show a spinner until the request completes and surface inline errors if something fails.
- The edit form includes an **Active** checkbox (checked by default for new records) so you can pre-set the state when creating or updating a schedule.
