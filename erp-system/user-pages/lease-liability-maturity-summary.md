# How to interpret the Lease Liability Maturity Summary

## 1. Select the anchor lease period
1. Open the **Lease Liability Maturity** report from the catalogue entry seeded at `reports/view/lease-liability-maturity`.
2. Pick the lease period that represents the reporting month you want to analyse and run the report.

## 2. Read the three maturity buckets
* **Current Period** – Shows the cash payment scheduled for the selected lease period. Use it to reconcile to the current-month
  lease expense.
* **Next 12 Months** – Aggregates the next twelve repayment periods, giving you the short-term undiscounted cash flow required
  for liquidity disclosures.
* **Beyond 12 Months** – Captures all remaining payments after the first year, enabling quick long-term liability checks.

## 3. Use the total column
The **Total** column equals the sum of the three buckets and represents the full undiscounted cash flow for each lease. Use it
as the control total when copying figures into the IFRS 16 maturity note.
