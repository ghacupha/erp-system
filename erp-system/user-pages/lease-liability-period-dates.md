# Lease Liability Schedule: Period Dates

The lease liability schedule now displays the configured repayment period start and end dates for each schedule item.

1. Navigate to **Lease Liability** > **Liability Schedule** for the desired lease.
2. Review the **Start** and **End** columns. Each row shows the start and end dates taken from the corresponding lease repayment period, alongside the period code.
3. Toggle the **Active only** switch when you want to hide inactive schedule rows that have been held back for review without deleting them.
4. (Optional) Select a **Compilation Request** from the filter bar to load only the rows generated by that approval run.
5. Use the visible dates to validate the timing of repayments and reconcile with accounting entries.
