The lease liability schedule now displays the configured repayment period start and end dates for each schedule item.

1. Navigate to **Lease Liability** > **Liability Schedule** for the desired lease.
2. Review the **Start** and **End** columns. Each row shows the start and end dates taken from the corresponding lease repayment period, alongside the period code.
3. Use these dates to validate the timing of repayments and reconcile with accounting entries.
