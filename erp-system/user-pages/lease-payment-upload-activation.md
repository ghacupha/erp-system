# Lease Payment Upload activation and paging

Use this guide to review and toggle lease payment uploads.

1. Navigate to **Leases → Lease Payment Upload**.
2. The **Previous uploads** table now shows 5 rows per page, sorted with the newest uploads first. Use the pagination controls under the table to move between pages.
3. The **Active** badge shows whether an upload is active. When a row is inactive, an **Activate** button appears in the Actions column; otherwise, a **Deactivate** button is shown.
4. Clicking **Activate** re-enables the upload and its related lease payments. **Deactivate** suspends them. The table updates in place and keeps your current page selection.
5. Changes are queued to reindex search results, so newly activated payments become searchable once the queue finishes processing.
