# Using the liability enumeration views

1. Open **Processing > Liability Enumeration** to view existing runs. The table is sorted by the most recent requests and shows the lease booking ID plus the local date-time the enumeration was initiated.
2. Use **Refresh** to reload the first page or scroll down to load additional pages when more results are available.
3. Click **Present values** on a row to open its schedule. The page title lists the related contract identifier so you know which lease you are reviewing.
4. From the present value page, use **Export CSV** or **Export XLSX** to download the current schedule for offline checks; the export respects the on-screen ordering.
