# Story: Browse the ROU depreciation schedule per lease contract

## Persona
- **Role:** Financial controller responsible for lease accounting disclosures.

## Steps
1. Opens the ERP web app and uses the report search box to type "ROU depreciation schedule".
2. Selects the suggested result which navigates to the ROU depreciation schedule dashboard.
3. Chooses the relevant IFRS16 lease contract from the dropdown at the top of the page.
4. Reviews the headline figures (initial ROU amount, total depreciation, closing NBV) and scrolls through the period-by-period rows.
5. Switches to a different lease contract using the same control to compare schedules without leaving the view.

## Expected outcome
- The schedule table shows the lease periods in order with depreciation and outstanding NBV values that match the backend calculation for the chosen contract.
- The totals update automatically when the controller changes the selected contract.
