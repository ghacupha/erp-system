## User story: Prefill interest paid transfer rule accounts from a lease template

**Persona:** Lease accountant configuring transfer rules.

**Goal:** Reduce manual entry by reusing debit and credit accounts defined on the lease template.

**Flow:**

1. Open the *Interest Paid Transfer Rule* creation page.
2. Select a lease contract that is tied to a lease template.
3. Observe the debit and credit account fields auto-populate with the template’s *interest paid transfer* accounts.
4. Optionally override either account if a different mapping is required for the rule being created.
5. Complete the remaining fields and save the rule.

**Outcome:** Template defaults accelerate setup while still permitting manual overrides when necessary.
