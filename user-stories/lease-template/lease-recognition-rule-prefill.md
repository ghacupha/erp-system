# TA Lease Recognition Rule Prefill from Lease Template

## Persona
- Financial accountant configuring recognition rules for a new IFRS16 lease.

## Steps
1. Open **TA Lease Recognition Rules** and start a new rule.
2. Select an IFRS16 lease contract that is linked to a lease template.
3. Observe that the Debit field fills with the template’s lease recognition debit account and the Credit field fills with the lease recognition credit account when they exist.
4. Review or override either account if needed and complete the rule save.

## Expected Result
- Debit and Credit default to the lease template’s recognition accounts when provided, reducing manual data entry while allowing optional overrides.
