# Story: Analyse lease liability maturity buckets

## Persona
Treasury analyst responsible for IFRS 16 liquidity disclosures.

## Trigger
The analyst selects the **Lease Liability Maturity** tile from the report catalogue and chooses a lease period to anchor the
calculation.

## Steps
1. Choose the reporting month from the lease period drop-down and run the report.
2. Review the returned table with one row per lease contract and four numeric columns: Current Period, Next 12 Months,
   Beyond 12 Months, and Total.
3. Export or copy the results into the statutory liquidity template used for IFRS 16 maturity analysis.

## Outcome
The analyst can explain how undiscounted lease cash flows are distributed across short-, medium-, and long-term buckets for the
selected period without recalculating totals in Excel.
