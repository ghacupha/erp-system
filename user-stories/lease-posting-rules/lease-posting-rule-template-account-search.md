# Lease posting rule template account search

## Persona
Lease accounting analyst responsible for configuring posting rules for new contracts.

## Scenario
The analyst wants to quickly find the right debit and credit transaction accounts without scrolling through a static list and wants the account category to be filled automatically.

## Steps
1. Navigate to **Ledgers → Posting Rules → Lease Posting Rule Configuration**.
2. Select an **Event Type** and choose a **Lease Contract**.
3. In the **Posting Rule Templates** section, click the **Debit Account** field and type a few characters (e.g., the account number or name) to narrow the list.
4. Select the desired debit account from the filtered results.
5. Repeat the search in the **Credit Account** field.

## Expected outcome
- The debit and credit account lists filter dynamically as the analyst types.
- The selected debit and credit account categories are prefilled based on the chosen transaction accounts.
- The debit and credit inputs remain aligned on the same row for quick comparison.
