# Case Study: ROU Asset Balance by Account Workflow Alignment

## Background
Troubleshooting the **ROU Asset Balance by Account** report required the lease period identifier to be visible in client requests. The legacy implementation passed the filter as a query parameter (`leasePeriodId.equals`) to the generic criteria endpoint. This design obscured the identifier in some tracing tools and risked combining the report with lease-liability specific filters.

## Objectives
* Surface the `leasePeriodId` directly in the REST path invoked by the Angular client.
* Remove the lease liability selector from the reporting UI for this specific summary.
* Allow analysts to fetch previously unseen lease periods by typing a partial or exact period code.

## Implementation Summary
1. **Metadata alignment** – Updated `ReportMetadataSeederExtension` so the backend API template now reads `api/leases/rou-account-balance-report-items/reports/{leasePeriodId}` and the report no longer advertises a lease liability filter.
2. **Dynamic endpoint resolution** – Enhanced `ReportSummaryDataService` with placeholder substitution logic. The service replaces tokens like `{leasePeriodId}` with runtime values and removes them from the query string prior to issuing the HTTP request.
3. **Lease period selector refresh** – Introduced incremental search support in `ReportSummaryViewComponent`. Typing a value such as `202502` triggers a fresh `LeasePeriodService.query` call with a `periodCode.contains` filter, ensuring the dropdown shows relevant results beyond the initial page.
4. **Regression coverage** – Added `report-summary-data.service.spec.ts` to verify placeholder handling so future refactors retain the behaviour.
5. **Export enablement (October 2025)** – Added CSV and Excel export buttons that marshal full report datasets via the new `fetchAllSummary` helper, introduced a reusable export utility for consistent formatting, and validated the download pipeline with targeted unit tests.

## Resulting Workflow
| Step | Actor | Action | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | User | Navigates to **ROU Asset Balance Report** | Report metadata loads with the new backend path |
| 2 | Client | Requests lease periods (lazy search enabled) | Dropdown lists the latest periods and updates on demand |
| 3 | User | Selects a lease period | Component stores the selection and triggers data refresh |
| 4 | Client | Calls `/api/leases/rou-account-balance-report-items/reports/{leasePeriodId}` | Server returns report rows for the selected period |
| 5 | User | Reviews report table | Data reflects the newly selected period without lease liability filtering |
| 6 | User | Chooses CSV or Excel export | The client fetches the complete dataset and downloads it with a timestamped filename |

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Network inspector shows URLs such as `/api/leases/rou-account-balance-report-items/reports/12345`.
- [x] Changing the typeahead term refreshes the lease period options.
- [x] Selecting a new period triggers a new summary fetch with zero lease liability parameters.
- [x] Export buttons are visible, display progress spinners during export, and yield files that include every column and record from the backend.

## Follow-up Considerations
* Monitor API telemetry for the new endpoint to confirm all report invocations include the path parameter.
* Evaluate extending the placeholder mechanism to other reports that rely on path-bound identifiers.
* Ensure seeded metadata is applied to existing environments by running the seeder or updating records manually where necessary.
