# Lease Posting Rule Configuration

## Purpose
Use the Lease Posting Rule Configuration page to create contract-specific posting rules that bundle rule metadata, templates, and conditions in a single workflow.

## How to configure a posting rule
1. Open **Lease Posting Rule Configuration** from the **Ledgers → Posting Rules** menu.
2. Enter a **Rule Name** and review the autogenerated identifier.
3. Select an **Event Type** and choose the relevant **Lease Contract**.
4. Confirm the suggested debit/credit accounts and account categories pulled from the lease template.
5. Use the debit and credit account search fields to narrow the list by typing part of the account number or name.
6. Verify that the debit and credit account categories prefill based on the selected transaction accounts.
7. Review the default condition for the lease contract ID and update it if a different condition is required.
8. Add or remove templates/conditions as needed.
9. Select **Save Posting Rule** to persist the rule.

## Tips
- Editing fields such as the rule name should remain responsive; if you update suggestions, the form will not overwrite your in-progress edits.
- Leave the module as **LEASE** to ensure the posting rule aligns with lease workflows.
- If you overwrite the suggested accounts, the account categories update automatically to match the new selection.
- Changing either the **Event Type** or **Lease Contract** refreshes the template debit and credit account suggestions and account categories.
- If you manually override the suggested accounts, the form keeps your selection even when you change the event type or lease contract.
- If a newly saved posting rule does not appear immediately in search results, wait a moment for indexing to complete and retry the search.

## Search and pagination
- When a search returns many posting rules, continue scrolling to load additional pages of results.
- If some recently deleted rules were still indexed, they will be filtered out of the list while the total count continues to represent the full search result set.
