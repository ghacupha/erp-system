# How to use present value prefilling on Lease Liability

1. Upload lease payments and run the liability enumeration for the target IFRS16 lease contract.
2. Navigate to **Lease Liability** and start a new liability for the same contract.
3. After selecting the contract, the form auto-populates:
   - **Liability Amount** with the sum of present values from the newest enumeration for that contract.
   - **Interest Rate** with the enumeration rate.
4. Verify the prefilled values and adjust only if a different enumeration should apply.
5. Save the liability to persist the auto-calculated amount and rate.

If no enumeration exists for the contract, the amount and rate remain blank so you can enter them manually.
