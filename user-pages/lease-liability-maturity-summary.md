# Lease Liability Maturity Summary Report

Use this report to break down lease liabilities into near-term and long-term obligations.

## Steps
1. Navigate to **Reports → Lease Liability Maturity**.
2. Choose the relevant Lease Period from the dropdown.
3. Run the report.

## Output
The table displays only the maturity buckets that have a non-zero combined balance. Each row shows:
- **Maturity Label** (≤365 days, 366–1824 days, ≥1825 days)
- **Lease Principal** (sum of outstanding balances)
- **Interest Payable** (sum of accrued interest)
- **Total** (principal + interest)

Expired leases are grouped into the ≤365 days band so that historic exposures remain visible.
