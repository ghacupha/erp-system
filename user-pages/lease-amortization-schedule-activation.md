3. Click **Activate** to switch an inactive schedule on. The button shows a spinner while the server updates the schedule and all linked liability schedule items.
4. Click **Deactivate** to pause a schedule. All related liability schedule items are marked inactive at the same time.
5. Use the edit page to adjust the **Active** checkbox when creating or editing a schedule; it defaults to checked for new schedules.
