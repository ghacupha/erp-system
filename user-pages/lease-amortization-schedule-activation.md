# Lease amortization schedule activation guide

1. Open **Leases → Lease Amortization Schedules**.
2. New schedules are created as **Active** and automatically linked to the lease liability compilation that produced them.
3. Click **Activate** to switch an inactive schedule on. The button shows a spinner while the server updates the schedule row, all compiled schedule items, and the parent compilation status.
4. Click **Deactivate** to pause a schedule. The same three layers are marked inactive so reporting ignores the run.
5. Use the edit page to adjust the **Active** checkbox when creating or editing a schedule; it defaults to checked for new schedules.
6. If an action fails, an inline error message appears under the row so you can retry after correcting the issue.
