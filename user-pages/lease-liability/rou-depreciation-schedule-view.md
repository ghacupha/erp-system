# Using the ROU depreciation schedule view

1. Open the ROU depreciation schedule page from the lease reporting menu.
2. In the **Lease contract (search to select)** box, start typing a booking ID or lease title and choose the lease from the suggestions.
3. The page reloads to `/rou-depreciation-schedule-view/<contractId>` and shows the depreciation periods for the selected contract.
4. Use the export buttons to download the visible schedule in CSV or Excel format.

**Tip:** If you visit the page with a contract ID already in the URL, the search box preloads that lease so you can confirm the selection before exporting.
