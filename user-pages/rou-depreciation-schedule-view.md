# ROU depreciation schedule dashboard

Use this page to review the period-by-period depreciation of a right-of-use asset.

## Steps
1. Open the report search in the navbar and type **ROU depreciation schedule**. Select the result to open the dashboard.
2. Pick an IFRS16 lease contract from the **Lease contract** dropdown. The page reloads the schedule for that contract.
3. Review the summary cards for the initial ROU amount, total depreciation to date and the closing net book value.
4. Scroll through the table to see each lease period, start and end dates, the depreciation charge and the outstanding amount.
5. Choose another contract from the dropdown to compare schedules; the summary and table update automatically.

## Notes
- The table follows lease periods (not repayment periods) and is sorted in the same order as the depreciation run.
- If the schedule fails to load, an alert appears so you can retry after verifying the contract selection.
