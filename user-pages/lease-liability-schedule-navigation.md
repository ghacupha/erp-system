# Running the Lease Liability Schedule Dashboard

1. Open the **Lease Reports** menu and choose **Liability Schedule Dashboard**.
2. The parameter screen shows a single field labelled *IFRS16 Lease Contract*.
   Start typing to search for the contract and pick the desired entry.
3. Click **Open Dashboard**. The application loads the liability schedule
   dashboard with the selected contract applied to the filter bar and the
   summary results refreshed.
4. If the dashboard is opened without a stored contract selection, the system
   redirects back to the parameter screen. Leaving the dashboard resets the
   selection so the next run starts with a blank form.
