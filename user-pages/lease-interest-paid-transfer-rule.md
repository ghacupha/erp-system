## Using lease templates to prefill interest paid transfer rules

1. Open the *Interest Paid Transfer Rule* form.
2. Choose the lease contract you want to map. If the lease is linked to a template, the UI retrieves that template.
3. The *Debit* and *Credit* fields automatically populate with the template’s **Interest Paid Transfer** accounts.
4. Review the suggested accounts. If a different mapping is required for this rule, select new debit or credit accounts—the prefill does not lock the fields.
5. Complete the remaining fields (name, identifier, placeholders) and save.

**Notes:** If the selected lease has no template or the template does not define transfer accounts, the debit and credit selections remain as-is so you can provide them manually.
