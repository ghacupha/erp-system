# Lease Liability Schedule: Period Dates

Refer to `erp-system/user-pages/lease-liability-period-dates.md` for guidance on the Start and End columns in the lease liability schedule. The shared guide also covers the new **Active only** toggle and **Compilation Request** filter so regional teams can hide dormant rows or focus on a specific compilation batch when reviewing period dates.
