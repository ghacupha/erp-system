# Lease Liability Schedule Upload Guide

Follow these steps to import a lease liability schedule from CSV:

1. Open the lease liability schedules module and choose **Upload CSV**.
2. Pick the lease liability, optional amortisation schedule, and verify the compilation batch that the system generated.
3. Attach the CSV file and submit the form.
4. Watch the upload status: `PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED`. If the status changes to `FAILED`, inspect the error log, correct the CSV, and try again.
5. Refresh the schedule items grid to confirm the imported rows.

Refer to the in-app help for the expected column order when preparing the CSV file.
