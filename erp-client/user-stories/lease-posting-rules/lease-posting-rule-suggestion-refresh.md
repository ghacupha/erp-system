# Lease posting rule suggestion refresh

## Persona
Lease accountant configuring posting rules for a specific lease contract.

## Scenario
The accountant wants the debit and credit account suggestions to stay aligned with both the event type and the selected lease contract.

## Steps
1. Open the **Lease Posting Rule Configuration** page.
2. Choose an **Event Type** such as **Lease Interest Accrual**.
3. Select the target **Lease Contract**.
4. Review the suggested debit and credit accounts and account categories in the first posting rule template.
5. Switch the **Event Type** to another option (for example, **Lease Repayment**).
6. Change the **Lease Contract** to another agreement.

## Expected outcome
- The posting rule template refreshes the debit and credit account suggestions to match the selected event type and lease contract.
- If the accountant manually overrides the suggested accounts, those manual selections are preserved.
