## User story: Prefill interest accrual rule accounts from a lease template

**Persona:** Lease accountant configuring interest accrual rules.

**Goal:** Reuse template-defined debit and credit mappings for accrued interest without manual lookup.

**Flow:**

1. Open the *Lease Interest Accrual Rule* creation page.
2. Select an IFRS16 lease contract that references a lease template.
3. Watch the Debit and Credit fields auto-populate with the template’s *interest accrued* accounts when they exist.
4. Override either account if a different mapping is needed.
5. Complete the remaining fields and save the rule.

**Outcome:** The template’s accrued-interest account defaults speed up setup while still permitting manual overrides.
