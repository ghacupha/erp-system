## User story: Prefill lease repayment rules from a lease template

**Persona:** Lease accountant configuring repayment rules.

**Goal:** Reuse template-defined repayment debit and credit mappings without retyping them when setting up a rule.

**Flow:**

1. Open the *Lease Repayment Rule* creation or edit page.
2. Select an IFRS16 lease contract that references a lease template.
3. Watch the Debit and Credit fields auto-populate with the template’s lease repayment accounts when they exist.
4. Override either account if the repayment mapping needs a different ledger.
5. Complete the remaining fields and save the rule.

**Outcome:** Template defaults speed up repayment rule setup while still allowing manual adjustments.
