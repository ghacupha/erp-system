# TA Lease Recognition Rule Prefill from Lease Template

## Persona
- Financial accountant adding a recognition rule for a new lease.

## Steps
1. Navigate to **TA Lease Recognition Rules** and create a rule.
2. Choose an IFRS16 lease contract that references a lease template.
3. Notice that the Debit and Credit fields auto-fill with the template’s lease recognition debit and credit accounts when provided.
4. Keep the defaults or override them, then save the rule.

## Expected Result
- The form pre-populates debit and credit from the lease template’s recognition mappings while still letting the accountant adjust the accounts before saving.
