# ROU Asset Balance by Account Report Workflow Update

## Overview
The ROU Asset Balance by Account summary view now calls the dedicated endpoint that requires a lease period identifier in the URL path. This change makes the client request structure match the server contract exposed by `RouAccountBalanceReportItemResourceProd#getRouAccountBalanceReportItems` and prevents any attempts to filter by lease liability when using this report.

## Navigation Path
1. Navigate to **ROU Reports ▸ ROU Asset Balance Report** in the ERP navigation drawer.
2. The application resolves the report metadata via `ReportMetadataService` and loads the summary view component at `app/erp/erp-reports/report-summary-view`.

## Updated Request Flow
1. The metadata seeder provides the backend path `api/leases/rou-account-balance-report-items/reports/{leasePeriodId}`.
2. `ReportSummaryDataService.fetchSummary` inspects the metadata path, replaces `{leasePeriodId}` with the selected period identifier, and issues a GET request to `/api/leases/rou-account-balance-report-items/reports/<leasePeriodId>`.
3. Only pagination parameters remain in the query string; the `leasePeriodId` is no longer appended as a criteria filter.
4. The server responds with the report rows for the specific lease period.

## Lease Period Search Behaviour
* The lease period selector now issues fresh lookups whenever a user types a new period code.
* Searches use the `periodCode.contains` filter on `LeasePeriodResource` so that partial entries like `202502` narrow the result set.
* When the user selects a lease period from the refreshed options, the component reloads the summary data using the selected identifier.

## Workflow Outcomes
* Eliminates accidental filtering by lease liability for this report.
* Exposes the lease period identifier explicitly in network traces, simplifying debugging.
* Ensures the selector can surface historical periods beyond the first 100 records returned at bootstrap.
* Provides single-click CSV and Excel exports that collect the complete dataset, not just the rows rendered in the paginated table.

## Export Enhancements (October 2025)
1. **UI controls** – Added compact export buttons to `report-summary-view.component.html`. The controls live next to the report header so analysts can initiate downloads immediately after reviewing on-screen results.
2. **Full dataset retrieval** – `ReportSummaryDataService.fetchAllSummary` now crawls through every page of the report endpoint. It reuses the existing placeholder and query parameter handling while iterating the `page` parameter until it reaches the end of the dataset.
3. **Reusable export helpers** – `report-summary-export.util.ts` standardises column ordering and value formatting. Both CSV and Excel output preserve the column order displayed in the UI and apply the same formatting rules defined by `formatValue`.
4. **Download flow** – The component converts the formatted data into a blob, generates a timestamped filename (e.g., `rou-asset-balance-report-20251024-161500.xlsx`), and triggers a browser download without leaving the page.
5. **Error handling** – When the backend returns no rows or an error occurs, the component surfaces clear alerts in the header instead of silently producing empty files.
6. **Regression coverage** – Added unit tests for both the component and the export utility to validate the CSV/Excel transformations and to verify the download flow wiring.
