## Prefilling interest paid transfer rules from lease templates (client)

1. Go to the *Interest Paid Transfer Rule* screen in the client.
2. Select the relevant lease contract. When that lease has an attached template, the form fetches it automatically.
3. The *Debit* and *Credit* controls prefill with the template’s interest paid transfer accounts.
4. If the suggested accounts are not appropriate, pick alternative debit or credit accounts—the defaults are only a starting point.
5. Finish the other required fields and save the rule.

**Tip:** If no template is present on the lease, or the template omits transfer accounts, the fields stay unchanged so you can enter the accounts manually.
