3. Enter a required template title.
4. Choose the transaction accounts, asset category, service outlet, and main dealer that should apply to related leases.
5. Save the template.

## Copy a Lease Template
1. From the Lease Templates list or detail view, select "Copy".
2. Adjust any fields as needed.
3. Save to create a new template.

## Use a Template on a Lease Contract
1. Open an IFRS16 lease contract and select Edit.
2. Choose a lease template from the Lease Template search field (type to filter options).
3. Confirm the service outlet and main dealer fields are populated as expected.
4. Save the contract.

## Apply Template Defaults to Amortization Rules

2. Choose an IFRS16 lease contract that is linked to a lease template.

## Apply Template Defaults to Lease Interest Accrual Rules
1. Open the Lease Interest Accrual Rule screen and start a new rule.

4. Override either account as needed before saving the rule.

## Apply Template Defaults to Lease Recognition Rules
1. Open the TA Lease Recognition Rules screen and start a new rule.
2. Select an IFRS16 lease contract that references a lease template.
