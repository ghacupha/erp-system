# ROU depreciation schedule dashboard (client)

1. Open **Lease Reports → ROU Depreciation Schedule** to load the navigation form at `/rou-depreciation-schedule-view/report-nav`.
2. Search for the IFRS16 lease contract in the M21 selector, submit the form, and land on `/erp/rou-depreciation-schedule-view/{contractId}`.
3. Confirm the summary cards showing the initial ROU amount, cumulative depreciation and closing net book value.
4. Review the table of lease periods with start/end dates, depreciation amounts and outstanding balance.
5. Switch to another contract using the dropdown to compare results without leaving the view.

If the page shows an error banner, reselect the contract or retry once the backend schedule API is available.
