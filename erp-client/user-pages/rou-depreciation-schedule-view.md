# ROU depreciation schedule dashboard (client)

1. From any page, use the report search and select **ROU depreciation schedule** to open the dashboard.
2. Choose the lease contract from the dropdown at the top right. The page reloads the ROU depreciation schedule for that contract.
3. Confirm the summary cards showing the initial ROU amount, cumulative depreciation and closing net book value.
4. Review the table of lease periods with start/end dates, depreciation amounts and outstanding balance.
5. Switch to another contract using the dropdown to compare results without leaving the view.

If the page shows an error banner, reselect the contract or retry once the backend schedule API is available.
