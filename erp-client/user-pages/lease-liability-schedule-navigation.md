# Client Guide: Lease Liability Schedule Dashboard

* Navigate to **Lease Reports â†’ Liability Schedule Dashboard**.
* Choose the relevant IFRS16 lease contract from the typeahead field and submit
  the form.
* Submitting the form jumps straight to `/erp/lease-liability-schedule-view/{id}`
  (replace `{id}` with the chosen contract identifier).
* Returning to the dashboard later requires a fresh selection because the form
  resets once you leave the report.
