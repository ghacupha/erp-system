# How to run a liability enumeration

1. Navigate to **Maintenance > Liability enumeration > Create**.
2. In **Lease contract**, start typing the contract name or booking ID and select the match from the NgSelect list.
3. In **Lease payment upload**, search for the upload associated with the chosen contract and pick it from the suggestions.
4. Enter the annual **Interest rate**. Set **Payment frequency** to the settlement cadence (monthly, quarterly, bi-annual or yearly). Discounting will always occur monthly, inserting zero-value months between non-monthly payments.
5. Leave **Active** checked if the enumeration should be processed immediately, then click **Enumerate**.

> Tip: Changing the lease contract clears the upload selection to prevent mismatched data.
