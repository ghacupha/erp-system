## Prefilling lease repayment rules from lease templates (client)

1. Open the *Lease Repayment Rule* screen.
2. Choose the lease contract to apply. If the lease is tied to a template, the form fetches it immediately.
3. The *Debit* and *Credit* fields prefill with the template’s lease repayment accounts whenever they are available.
4. If you prefer different ledgers, select alternative debit or credit accounts—the defaults are only a starting point.
5. Finish the remaining required fields and save the rule.

**Tip:** When no template or repayment accounts exist on the selected lease, the fields stay unchanged so you can enter values manually.
