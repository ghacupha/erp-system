# TA ROU Recognition Rule Auto-Population

## Purpose
When you select a lease contract while creating or editing a TA Recognition ROU Rule, the
system can automatically fill in the debit and credit accounts from the lease template.
This ensures your recognition rule stays aligned with the lease setup.

## How to Use
1. Open the TA Recognition ROU Rule create or edit form.
2. Choose a lease contract in the Lease Contract field.
3. Review the Debit and Credit fields:
   - If the lease template defines ROU recognition accounts, the fields will populate
     automatically.
   - If the template does not include these accounts, the fields remain unchanged and you
     can select them manually.

## Tips
- Ensure the lease template linked to the contract includes ROU recognition debit and
  credit accounts to take advantage of auto-population.
