# Lease Posting Rule Configuration

## Purpose
The Lease Posting Rule Configuration screen lets you define contract-specific posting rules with templates and conditions in one place.

## Steps
1. Open the page from **Ledgers → Posting Rules**.
2. Enter the **Rule Name** and review the identifier.
3. Select the **Event Type** and **Lease Contract**.
4. Confirm suggested debit/credit accounts and account categories.
5. Type into the debit and credit account fields to filter the account list as needed.
6. Confirm the account categories update based on the selected transaction accounts.
7. Adjust templates or conditions if needed.
8. Save the posting rule.

## What to expect
- The form remains responsive while you edit fields such as the rule name.
- Suggestions from the lease template update only the relevant account fields.
- Changing the template debit or credit account updates the associated account category automatically.
- Changing the event type or lease contract refreshes the suggested template accounts.
